I am currently a Ph.D. student in computational mathematics at [School of Mathematical Sciences (SMS)](http://english.math.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University (PKU)](https://english.pku.edu.cn/). My Ph.D. supervisor is Prof. [Tiejun Li](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/litj/) and I am co-advised by [Peijie Zhou](https://cliffzhou92.github.io/). My current research interests lie in *computational systems biology*, *AI for science*, and *computational physics*. 

Prior to that, I received my B.S. degree (2023) in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from [Cuiying Honors College (CHC)](http://chc.lzu.edu.cn/About_us.htm), [Lanzhou University (LZU)](https://en.lzu.edu.cn/static/Overview/). During June 2022 to September 2023, I conducted research under the guidance of  Prof. [Zhennan Zhou](https://its.westlake.edu.cn/info/1108/2087.htm), at [Beijing International Center for Mathematical Research (BICMR)](https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University.

I have a great interest in applied mathematics, especially in the interdisciplinary field involving mathematics.  My aspiration is to combine mathematics with  machine intelligence  across diverse fields, tackling practical challenges and advancing our comprehension of fundamental principles and mechanisms. Thatâ€™s what I want to pursue in the future.
