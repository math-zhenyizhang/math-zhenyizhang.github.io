I am Zhenyi Zhang and I am about to join [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/) at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/) as a PhD student.
Before that, I received my BSc(Hons) degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from [Cuiying Honors College](http://chc.lzu.edu.cn/), [Lanzhou University](https://en.lzu.edu.cn/). 

I have a great interest in applied mathematics, especially in the interdisciplinary field involving mathematics. Nowadays mathematics has played an important role in more and more scientific problems. We hope to apply rigorous mathematical tools in more fields to reveal existing phenomena and solve practical problems. Thatâ€™s what I want to pursue in the future.
