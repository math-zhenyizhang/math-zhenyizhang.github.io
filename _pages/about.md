Greetings! I am Zhenyi Zhang, currently an undergraduate student in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics in [Cuiying Honors College](http://chc.lzu.edu.cn/), [Lanzhou University](https://en.lzu.edu.cn/). And I'm expected to graduate in July 2023.

I have a great interest in applied mathematics, especially in the interdisciplinary field involving mathematics. Nowadays mathematics has played an important role in more and more scientific problems. We hope to apply rigorous mathematical tools in more fields to reveal existing phenomena and solve practical problems. That's what I want to pursue in the future.
