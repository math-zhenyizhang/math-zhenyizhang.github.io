Biography
---
I am Zhenyi, currently an undergraduate student in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics in Lanzhou University. I have a great interest in applied mathematics. It is hoped that mathematical theory can provide some different research perspectives on real scientific problems. And that's what I want to pursue in the future.
