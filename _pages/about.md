Hi! I am Zhenyi, currently a Ph.D. student in Computational Mathematics at [School of Mathematical Sciences(SMS)](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/index.htm), [Peking University(PKU)](https://english.pku.edu.cn/). My Ph.D. supervisor is Prof. [Tiejun Li](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/litj/).

Prior to that, I received my B.S. degree(2023) in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from [Cuiying Honors College(CHC)](http://chc.lzu.edu.cn/), [Lanzhou University(LZU)](https://en.lzu.edu.cn/). During June 2022 to September 2023, I conducted research under the guidance of  Prof. [Zhennan Zhou](http://faculty.bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~zhennan/), at [Beijing International Center for Mathematical Research(BICMR)](https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University.

I have a great interest in applied mathematics, especially in the interdisciplinary field involving mathematics. Nowadays mathematics has profound implications across various scientific disciplines. We aspire to employ mathematical tools across various fields, addressing practical problems and working towards a better understanding of underlying mechanisms. Thatâ€™s what I want to pursue in the future. 

My current research interests lie in *computational systems biology*, *bioinformatics*, and *computational physics*. Any discussions are more than welcome.
