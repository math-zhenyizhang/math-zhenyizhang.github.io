I am Zhenyi, currently a PhD student in Computational Mathematics at [School of Mathematical Sciences(SMS)](http://english.math.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/).
Prior to that, I received my BSc degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from [Cuiying Honors College(CHC)](http://chc.lzu.edu.cn/), [Lanzhou University](https://en.lzu.edu.cn/). 

I have a great interest in applied mathematics, especially in the interdisciplinary field involving mathematics. Nowadays mathematics has profound implications across various scientific disciplines. We aspire to employ mathematical tools across various fields, uncovering existing phenomena and working towards a better understanding of underlying mechanisms. Thatâ€™s what I want to pursue in the future.
