I am Zhenyi, currently a PhD student in Computational Mathematics at [School of Mathematical Sciences](http://english.math.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/).
Prior to that, I received my BSc degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from [Cuiying Honors College](http://chc.lzu.edu.cn/), [Lanzhou University](https://en.lzu.edu.cn/). 

I have a great interest in applied mathematics, especially in the interdisciplinary field involving mathematics. Nowadays mathematics has profound implications across various scientific disciplines. We hope to apply rigorous mathematical tools in more fields to reveal existing phenomena and solve practical problems. Thatâ€™s what I want to pursue in the future.
