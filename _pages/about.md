Welcome! I am currently a PhD student in Computational Mathematics at [School of Mathematical Sciences(SMS)](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/index.htm), [Peking University(PKU)](https://english.pku.edu.cn/). My PhD supervisor is Prof. [Tiejun Li](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/litj/).

Prior to that, I received my B.S. degree(2023) in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from [Cuiying Honors College(CHC)](http://chc.lzu.edu.cn/), [Lanzhou University(LZU)](https://en.lzu.edu.cn/), adivsed by Prof. [Weihua Deng](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8573-012X). During June 2022 to September 2023, I also conducted research under the guidance of  Prof. [Zhennan Zhou](http://faculty.bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~zhennan/), at [Beijing International Center for Mathematical Research(BICMR)](https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University.

I have a great interest in applied mathematics, especially in the interdisciplinary field involving mathematics. Nowadays mathematics has profound implications across various scientific disciplines. We aspire to employ mathematical tools across various fields, addressing practical problems and working towards a better understanding of underlying mechanisms. Thatâ€™s what I want to pursue in the future.
